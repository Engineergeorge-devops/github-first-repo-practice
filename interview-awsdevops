• The first time we ask a file to be tracked, and every time 
before we commit a file, we must add it to the staging area: 
– git add Hello.java Goodbye.java 
• Takes a snapshot of these files, adds them to the staging area. 
• In older VCS, "add" means "start tracking this file." In Git, "add" 
means "add to staging area" so it will be part of the next commit. 
• To move staged changes into the repo, we commit: 
– git commit –m "Fixing bug #22" 
• To undo changes on a file before you have committed it: 
– git reset HEAD -- filename (unstages the file)
– git checkout -- filename (undoes your changes)
– All these commands are acting on your local version of repo.
